# Next-Word-Prediction-Using-Bert
 "Next-Word Prediction Using BERT" is a fascinating application of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).

# Workflow
Problem Understanding:
I aimed to predict the most probable continuation of a sentence, which has applications in text generation, autocompletion, and conversational AI.

Data Preparation:
Sentences were tokenized using Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library.
Tokenization involves splitting the text into smaller units (subwords or words) and converting them into integer IDs that the model understands.

Model Selection:
I used BERT, a pre-trained transformer model. It was chosen for its ability to understand bidirectional context in text, making it suitable for word predictions.

Fine-Tuning:
Masked tokens were appended at the end of input sentences.
BERT was fine-tuned to predict the masked tokens by training on a large text corpus.

Prediction:
After fine-tuning, the model was used to infer the most likely 5-6 words for incomplete sentences.
Output:

The model produced a sequence of predicted words with high confidence scores, completing the input sentence logically.
